            The Modeling Covid-19 (MC19) project is an epidemiological model of
            Covid-19 fit to actual social distancing, testing, and fatality
            data. We use this data to project how Covid-19 might spread through
            a population for different <strong>locations</strong> and different{' '}
            <strong>social distancing scenarios</strong>.

            </strong>{' '}
            and we’re thankful for the many people and organizations who have
            worked to produce the data that powers the model. All data has its
            caveats and limitations: due to (still) limited testing, cases are
            undercounted to a large degree that varies by state. Fatality counts
            are generally seen as more reliable, but analysis of all-cause
            mortality indicates that they are often{' '}

            The impact of social distancing

          <Paragraph>
            To illustrate how social distancing can impact the spread of
            Covid-19, we’ll use an example location — {location.name} — and
            consider two scenarios: one without social distancing and one with
            significant social distancing.
          </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph className="pullquote">
              What might happen if{' '}
              <strong>{location.name} stops social distancing</strong> and
              returns to normal?
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The model projects that if the virus is allowed to spread
              uninhibited <strong>without social distancing measures</strong>,
              the <CurrentlyHospitalizedLabel /> will quickly exceed the
              available <HospitalCapacityLabel /> in {location.name}, which will
              increase the <TotalFatalitiesLabel />.
            </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            Now consider an alternate scenario, with a social distancing period:
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph className="pullquote">
            What might happen if <strong>{location.name}</strong> enacts a

              social distancing levels
            </strong>
            —the same amount as{' '}

            ?
          </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            In this example, the model predicts that the{' '}
            <strong>social distancing period</strong> slows the spread of the
            virus, which allows the <CurrentlyHospitalizedLabel /> to remain
            below <HospitalCapacityLabel />, and lessen the{' '}
            <TotalFatalitiesLabel />.

          <Paragraph>
            Our model is based upon a standard epidemiological model called{' '}

              <CurrentScenario format={formatDistancingDuration} length={7} />
            </strong>
            , the model projects that Covid-19 cases would stabilize:

          <Paragraph>
            Comparing the two examples demonstrates how social distancing plays
            a significant role in how the virus might spread. The model projects
            that scenarios with little or no social distancing result in the
            virus spreading through the population quickly, while scenarios with
            significant social distancing suppress the virus and result in fewer
            cases overall.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            However, we also need to consider what happens after our distancing
            period ends. What might happen if we return to normal after social
            distancing?
          </Paragraph>
        </XScaleDistancingPeriod>

        <Title className="margin-top-4">The second wave</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          Let’s look at our social distancing example on a longer timeframe. If
          we continue to model further into the future, we can project what
          might occur if we return to normal:
        </Paragraph>
        <SEIRGraph height={height.regular} width={width} scrubber={false} />
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>
            By the end of the social distancing period the majority of the
            population is projected to still be susceptible to Covid-19.
          </strong>{' '}
          While the model projects that the social distancing measures drive
          cases down to nearly zero, some cases remain. If left unchecked, the
          model predicts that these cases will cause another outbreak, creating
          a <strong>second wave</strong> of infections.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The second wave appears similar to the example without social
          distancing above. The model projects it will put a similar level of
          strain on {location.name}’s hospital system:
        </Paragraph>
        <HospitalizationGraph
          height={height.regular}
          width={width}
          scrubber={false}
        />

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>Is it possible to avoid the second wave?</strong> One option
          is to continue social distancing until a <strong>vaccine</strong> is
          developed, which experts estimate will take at least a year. A vaccine
          would allow the population to develop herd immunity without requiring
          mass infections.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>“Test and trace”</strong> is another approach that involves
          tracking the virus to identify and suppress future outbreaks{' '}
          <em>without</em> establishing herd immunity. This approach could allow
          distancing restrictions to ease, but only if certain conditions are
          met.
        </Paragraph>

        <Title className="margin-top-4">Test and trace</Title>

          shows that with a “test and trace” strategy it’s possible to ease
          distancing restrictions and still prevent exponential growth for a
          period of time. Specifically, the data suggests that distancing
          restrictions can be reduced when the number of new cases per day falls
          below two cases per million people. To keep the virus contained, data
          suggests that for every 100 tests performed, only one should come back
          positive and 80% of positive tests should be able to be traced back to
          another known case.
